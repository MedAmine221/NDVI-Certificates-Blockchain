This work is part of the AgriTrustChain platform, which aims to provide transparent and verifiable storage and certification of land and soil information. The proposed module automates the generation of land certifications using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and leverages blockchain technology to ensure data integrity and immutability. The Certification Contract encodes domain-specific rules and automatically issues tamper-proof digital certificates upon compliance. When a plot of land meets the eligibility criteria (validated off-chain), a non-fungible token (NFT) is minted to represent the certification. The NFT, compliant with the ERC-721 standard, guarantees both uniqueness and traceability. Each certificate includes: (i) a link to the off-chain PDF report (IPFS hash), (ii) detailed land information, and (iii) certification metadata such as NDVI and eligibility status
